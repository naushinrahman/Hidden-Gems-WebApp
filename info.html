                    <p>Grey Abbey Park is a waterfront park that runs along the Scarborough Bluffs.
                        This park is near the intersection of Morningside Ave and Guildwood parkway. 
                        It can be accessed by the 116 Morningside bus or by walking.  
                        It is located at the edge of the suburbs and has many a small walking trail as well as many benches.
                        I recommend coming here with a friend, a picnic blanket and nothing else. 
                        Its a quiet place great for conversation, clearing your mind and watching the birds and the clouds.

                    <p>Midori Ramen is a restaurant in Downtown Toronto created by chefs Masaru Ogasawara and Natsuhiko Sugimoto.
                        Their passion for Japanese Cuisine and experience in the food industry has kept their restaurant bustling
                        and since opening they have expanded to 3 more locations.
                        Their location on Spadina and Queen is close to the DVP or you can commute there with the 510 Spadina streetcar.
                        It has a great selection of vegetarian options as well as delicious and unique starters.
                        I recommend the Spicy Tan Tan as a filling and flavorful dinner with a great kick. 
                        If you don't like spicy food the Black Garlic Vegetarian balances the umami flavour of garlic with a light shoyu broth and is sure to please.

                    <p>Savings Mondays is a cafe with the mission to make you not hate Mondays. They offer a variety of teas, pastries, warm drinks and cookies. 
                        Their bagels combine many different ingredients to make unique combinations at an affordable price, their O.G Lox is a personal favorite of mine!
                        Savings Mondays is about a 2 minute walk east from the Bloor GO Train station and 11 minute walk from the Dundas West Station. 
                        You can also take the 40 Junction-Dundas West Bus to reach it as well.
                        I recommend coming here when you want to read a book or get some homework done and need a new environment. And when you need a break try their Salt Flake City cookie or Matcha latte.

                    <p>Guild Park is park secluded at the edge of Scarborough that combines art and nature. Originally home to an artists' colony in the late 1800s, the park now an array of sculptures.
                        The park also has a few banquet halls for rental available throughout the year. It is a popular spot for weddings and birthdays and you will often see many people doing their own photoshoots here.
                        You can reach Guild Park by foot, by following the scenic trail starting from Lakefront Avenue which runs along the Scarborough Bluffs. 
                        For drivers, take Guildwood Parkway, turning onto Sylvan Avenue, where ample parking is available. 
                        If you're using public transit, take Bus 116 from Kennedy Station, and it will drop you off just a short walk away from the park's entrance.
                        I recommend coming to Guild Park for picnics or if you have a nice camera come have a photoshoot here!

                    <p>Arctic Bites is a dessert cafe that has two specialities- bubble waffle and their prized rolled ice cream.
                        If you're on foot, head south on Elm Street from the main square, and you'll find Arctic Bites nestled between a bookstore and a cozy caf√© at 21 Baldwin Street. 
                        For drivers, take the third right after the clock tower onto Maple Avenue, then make a left onto Elm Street. 
                        Public transit enthusiasts can take the Green Line subway to Elm Street Station, a mere two-minute walk from them.
                        Their -Thai-to-go- rolled ice cream is so sweet and creamy its a great way to start your weekend plans. 
                        I also love their Strawberry -Love at First Bite- with a waffle, it is so filing it's like a meal itself!
