            <h1>About the author</h1>
                <p>My Name is Naushin Rahman and I am an aspiring software developer. 
                    The spots that I picked are places that I have frequently visited
                    throughout my years of living here. I often go to the listed parks to clear my mind 
                    and enjoy the nature. The restaurants and cafes are places I go with friends. We enjoy
                    exploirng small mom-and-pop joints and supporting local businesses.
                    
                </p>
